Like the [Legendre symbol evaluator][legendre], this came from the Open
University course [M381 -- Number theory and mathematical logic][m381].

It can evaluate [URMs][urm] (Unlimited Register Machines) using
JavaScript. The syntax of the program is quite forgiving -- it doesn't
care how the instructions are spelled, as long as the first letter is
correct. (Also, either T or C can be used for the transfer instruction.)
